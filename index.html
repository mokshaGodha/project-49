              <p>Interesting facts about CAMELS: <br> Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds 
              of fat which they can live off for weeks and even
              months!
              <br>
              Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
              <br>
              Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day.

              <p>Interesting facts about ELEPHANTS:<br>An elephant’s skin is 2.5cm thick in most places.
               The folds and wrinkles in their skin can retain up to 10 times more water than flat skin does, which helps to cool them down.
              <br>
              Elephants need up to 150kg of food per day – that's around 375 tins of baked beans although half of this may leave the body undigested.
              <br>
              Amazingly, elephant calves are able to stand within 20 minutes of being born and can walk within 1hour. After two days, they can keep up with the herd.

              <br>
              A bunny's big ears aren't just for listening, those amazing ears can also be rotated almost a full circle to 270 degrees!
              <br>
              Like deer, a female rabbit is called a “doe” and a male rabbit is called a “buck.”
              <br>
              To express happiness, bunnies will sometimes jump around and flick their heads and feet.
